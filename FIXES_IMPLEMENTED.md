# Stream Discovery Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend P2P Transport Configuration
**File**: `/backend/libp2p/p2pNode.mjs`

**Changes**:
- Added WebSocket transport import (line 8)
- Added WebSocket to transports array (line 49)
- This allows browser clients to connect to the backend node

```javascript
// Before: Only TCP
transports: [tcp()],

// After: TCP + WebSocket
transports: [tcp(), webSockets()],
```

### 2. Backend GossipSub Configuration
**File**: `/backend/libp2p/p2pNode.mjs` (lines 73-81)

**Changes**:
- Added `floodPublish: true` - enables flood publishing for better initial discovery
- Added `heartbeatInterval: 1000` - faster gossip heartbeat for quicker message propagation
- Added `scoreParams` - improves peer scoring for message distribution

```javascript
pubsub: gossipsub({
  emitSelf: false,
  allowPublishToZeroTopicPeers: true,
  signMessages: true,
  strictSigning: true,
  floodPublish: true,                    // NEW
  heartbeatInterval: 1000,               // NEW
  scoreParams: {                         // NEW
    topicScoreCap: 32.72,
    appSpecificScore: 1.0
  }
})
```

### 3. Frontend Peer Discovery Wait Logic
**File**: `/frontend/app/streams/page.tsx` (lines 60-88)

**Changes**:
- Added 12-second discovery loop that waits for peers to connect
- Real-time stream updates as they're discovered
- Improved logging to show discovery progress
- Updates UI immediately when streams arrive

```typescript
// Waits up to 12 seconds for:
while (Date.now() - startDiscovery < 12000) {
  const peers = p2pNode.getPeers();
  const streams = dir.getDiscoveredStreams();
  console.log(`[DEBUG] Discovery loop - Peers: ${peers.length}, Streams: ${streams.length}`);
  
  if (streams.length > discoveredCount) {
    discoveredCount = streams.length;
    setStreams(streams);  // Update UI in real-time!
  }
  
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500));
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging - Frontend Directory
**File**: `/frontend/lib/libp2p/streamDirectory.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added message type logging in `handleDirectoryMessage()` (line 213)
- Added stream metadata logging in `handleAnnouncement()` (line 255)
- Better visibility into what messages are being received

```typescript
// Shows which message types are arriving
console.log(`[DEBUG] Received ${message.type} message from ${fromPeer.slice(0, 20)}...`);

// Shows stream details as they arrive
console.log(`   Name: ${message.metadata.name}, Category: ${message.metadata.category}`);
```

### 5. Enhanced Debug Logging - Backend Directory
**File**: `/backend/libp2p/streamDirectory.mjs`

**Changes**:
- Added message type logging in `handleDirectoryMessage()` (line 253)
- Added stream details in `handleAnnouncement()` (line 299)
- Same visibility as frontend for cross-platform debugging

### 6. Enhanced Debug Logging - P2P Node
**File**: `/backend/libp2p/p2pNode.mjs`

**Changes**:
- Added subscriber count logging in `publishToTopic()` (line 188-189)
- Shows which topics have active subscribers before publishing
- Helps diagnose message propagation issues

```javascript
const peers = getTopicPeers(node, topic);
console.log(`[DEBUG] Publishing to ${topic} (${peers.length} subscribers)`);
```

### 7. API Server Auto-Publish Initialization
**File**: `/backend/apiServer.js` (lines 713-726)

**Changes**:
- Changed server startup to async
- Automatically calls `autoPublishNewStreams()` on startup
- Ensures streams are published immediately when server starts
- Removes dependency on file watching for initial publish

```javascript
app.listen(PORT, async () => {
  // ... existing logs ...
  
  if (AUTO_PUBLISH_ENABLED) {
    try {
      console.log('🔄 Initializing libp2p auto-publish on startup...');
      await autoPublishNewStreams();
      startStreamsWatcher();
      console.log('✓ Auto-publish initialized and watching for streams');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('❌ Failed to initialize auto-publish:', error.message);
    }
  }
})
```

## How These Fixes Work Together

1. **Transport Mismatch Fixed**: Backend now has WebSocket transport, browser can connect
2. **Message Propagation Improved**: Better gossipsub configuration ensures messages spread quickly
3. **Race Condition Fixed**: Frontend waits 12 seconds for peers and announcements instead of querying immediately
4. **Real-time UI Updates**: Streams appear as they're discovered, not after the wait period
5. **Better Diagnostics**: Debug logging shows exactly what's happening at each step
6. **Startup Publishing**: Streams are published immediately when backend starts

---

## Testing the Fixes

### Terminal 1: Start Backend
```bash
yarn p2p:start
```

Expected logs:
```
🚀 Argus Defense API Server running on http://localhost:3001
🔄 Initializing libp2p auto-publish on startup...
📡 Found 5 new stream(s)
✅ Auto-published stream: local-argus-defense---introduction-1-mp3
✅ Auto-published stream: local-argus-defense---a-secure-platform...
[etc for all 5 streams]
✓ Auto-publish initialized and watching for streams
```

### Terminal 2: Start Frontend
```bash
yarn start
```

Expected console logs in DevTools (F12):
```
🚀 Starting browser libp2p node...
✅ Browser libp2p node started!
📍 Peer ID: 12D3Koo...
🔍 Discovered peer: QmN... (bootstrap peer)
🤝 Connected to peer: Qm... (bootstrap peer)
🌐 Starting browser stream directory...
📢 Subscribed to topic: argus-defense/stream-directory
✅ Browser stream directory started
⏳ Waiting for peer discovery and stream announcements...
[DEBUG] Discovery loop - Peers: 0, Streams: 0
[DEBUG] Discovery loop - Peers: 1, Streams: 0  (bootstrap peer connected)
[DEBUG] Received announce from Qm... (backend announcing streams)
📢 Discovered stream: local-argus-defense---introduction-1-mp3
   Name: Argus Defense - Introduction, Category: Information
[DEBUG] Discovery loop - Peers: 2, Streams: 1
📢 Discovered stream: local-argus-defense---project-mission-1-mp3
   Name: Argus Defense - Project Mission, Category: Information
[etc...]
✓ Connected to 2 peer(s), waiting for stream announcements...
🔍 Final stream discovery query...
```

### In Browser
- Streams page should show:
  - "Connected Peers: 2" (or more)
  - "Discovered Streams: 5"
  - All 5 streams in the grid with names and categories

## Key Files Modified

1. `/backend/libp2p/p2pNode.mjs` - Transport & gossipsub config
2. `/backend/libp2p/streamDirectory.mjs` - Debug logging  
3. `/backend/apiServer.js` - Auto-publish initialization
4. `/frontend/app/streams/page.tsx` - Discovery wait loop
5. `/frontend/lib/libp2p/streamDirectory.ts` - Debug logging

---

## Troubleshooting

If streams still aren't appearing:

1. **Check backend is publishing**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/libp2p/streams
   ```
   Should show 5 streams

2. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Look for "Discovered peer" messages
   - Look for "Discovered stream" messages
   - Look for debug messages with peer and stream counts

3. **Check peer connection**:
   - If "Connected Peers: 0", peers aren't connecting
   - This means transport issue or bootstrap problems

4. **Check message propagation**:
   - If peers connected but no streams appear
   - Backend logs should show "Publishing to argus-defense/stream-directory (N subscribers)"
   - Frontend should show "[DEBUG] Received announce" messages

---

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set when running `yarn p2p:start`:

```bash
LIBP2P_AUTO_PUBLISH=true        # Enable stream publishing
LIBP2P_AUTO_PUBLISH_LIMIT=5     # Max streams per update
API_PORT=3001                   # Backend API port
```

These are set by the `yarn p2p:start` script in `package.json` line 56.

---

## Summary

All fixes are designed to:
1. Enable browser-to-backend P2P connectivity (WebSocket)
2. Improve message propagation (gossipsub config)
3. Handle initialization timing (discovery wait loop)
4. Provide visibility into what's happening (debug logging)
5. Ensure streams are published on startup (auto-publish init)

Streams should now appear on the frontend within 12 seconds of page load.
